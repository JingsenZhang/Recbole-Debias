# RecBole-Debias

**RecBole-Debias** is a toolkit built upon [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) for reproducing and developing debiased recommendation algorithms.

## Highlights

* **Unified**

    Unified framework, which includes several algorithms for different kinds of biases. Meanwhile, three datasets in which the distribution of training set and test set is different are provided for evaluation.

* **Adaptive**

    Adaptive to many base recommendation models. For simplicity, the current implementation is only based on MF model.
    
* **Closely**

    Closely related to Recbole. The toolkit fully adopts the functions of Recbole, except that certain algorithms need to design unique components like trainer.

## Requirements

```
python>=3.7.0
pytorch>=1.7.0
recbole~=1.0.0
```

## Quick-Start

With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```bash
python run_recbole_debias.py
```

If you want to change the models or datasets, just run the script by setting additional command parameters:

```bash
python run_recbole_debias.py -m [model] -d [dataset] -c [config_files]
```

## Implemented Models
